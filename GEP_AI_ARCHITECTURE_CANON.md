# 🧠 GEP AI Architecture - Canon (The Rule)

## THE CORE PRINCIPLE

**GEP does NOT choose one AI. GEP chooses the BEST AI FOR EACH JOB — based on what the market already associates that model with.**

That's it. That's the governing rule.

You're building a modular AI system, not a cult.

---

## ✅ WHY THIS IS RIGHT

- Nobody says: "Let's use ChatGPT for images."
- People say: **NanoBanana / Gemini for images & creative identity.**
- People say: **SOAR / Sora-style for video.**
- People use **ChatGPT for reasoning, explanation, coaching, and dialogue.**

GEP mirrors how the market already thinks, not fight it.

That makes adoption easier, demos clearer, and fundraising cleaner.

## 🧱 THE CORRECT GEP AI ARCHITECTURE

**You can now say this without sounding confused:**

> "GEP uses a modular AI architecture.
> 
> Creative identity and storytelling are powered by Gemini/NanoBanana.
> 
> Execution and coaching are powered by OpenAI.
> 
> Scoring and trust are handled deterministically in-house."

**That sounds:**
- ✅ Thoughtful
- ✅ Non-biased

## ✅ WHAT TO DO NEXT

**Create an AI Adapter Layer**

```
GeminiAdapter    → Creative/Identity features
OpenAIAdapter    → Coaching/Guidance features
VideoAdapter     → Video generation (future)
LogicEngine      → Scoring/Trust features
```

**Cursor can wire APIs once, then features just call the adapter they need.**

- **OpenAI** = "WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT" (Guidance, Coaching, Execution)
- **Code** = "WHAT'S ALLOWED" (Trust, Scoring, Safety)
- **SOAR** = "VIDEO MAGIC" (Future, Optional)

**That's it. That's the architecture.**
